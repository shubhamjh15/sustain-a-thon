## Project Title
Sustain-a-thon

## Describe your project in one sentence (max 100 characters)
Gamifying sustainability with AI coaching and real-time tracking to make saving the planet fun.

## Describe what your project does and its main features. How does it work from a user's perspective?
Sustain-a-thon is a gamified platform attacking eco-anxiety. Users log actions (like recycling) to earn XP and unlock badges, visualizing their impact with interactive charts. It features **EcoBot**, a GenAI coach (powered by Gemini) that gives personalized, optimistic advice based on user stats. It also includes micro-learning modules to demystify climate science. From a user's perspective, it feels like a game: you login, complete daily "missions," chat with the AI for tips, and watch your "CO2 Saved" graph grow, turning a daunting global crisis into a manageable, rewarding personal challenge.

## What were the biggest obstacles you faced during development? How did you attempt to overcome them?
One major hurdle was **hallucinations in the AI**. We wanted EcoBot to be "youthful" but scientifically accurate. We overcame this by implementing strict system prompts and feeding the AI real-time user state (level, badges) context, grounding its responses. Another challenge was **state persistence**. Ensuring the "gamified" feel meant level-ups needed to be instant. We struggled with React render loops when syncing complex XP logic with local storage, but resolved it by building a custom hook for optimized state synchronization.

## What are you most proud of achieving? What milestones did you hit that felt significant?
We are proud of **Zero-Latency Interactions**; the app feels native. We also nailed the **EcoBot persona**—it feels like a friend. Finally, building a dynamic **Leveling System** that unlocks badges based on real user data was a major milestone.

## What new skills, technologies, or concepts did you learn while building this project?
We learned deep **Prompt Engineering** to control LLM tone with JSON context. We also mastered **Neo-Brutalist design** (hard shadows/borders) in Tailwind, and learned **Client-Side Optimization** to structure data models for future SQL migration.

## What are your plans for future development? What features would you like to add?
We plan to migrate persistence to **Supabase** for multiplayer features and "Guild" competitions. We also want to launch a **React Native mobile app** using computer vision to automatically verify recycled items via camera.

## How does your project address environmental or social sustainability? What impact could it have?
Sustain-a-thon directly addresses **Social Sustainability** by combating "Climate Doomism." By shifting the narrative from fear to fun, we empower individuals who feel helpless. Environmentally, if just 1,000 users complete our daily "Meat-Free Meal" mission, we save tons of CO2 weekly. It bridges the gap between *knowing* you should help and actually *doing* it by leveraging the psychology of video games for the planet good.
