## 🌍 Abstract & Motivation

> **The Problem:**  
> "Eco-Anxiety" and "Climate Doomism" are paralyzing. People often feel their individual actions are too small to matter in the face of global climate change.
>
> **The Solution:**  
> **Sustain-a-thon** shifts the narrative from *fear* to *fun*. By applying game mechanics—XP, levels, badges, and streaks—we make sustainable living addictive. It bridges the gap between *knowing* you should help and actually *doing* it.
